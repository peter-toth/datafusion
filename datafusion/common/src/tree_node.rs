///
/// - If the expression returns [`TreeNodeRecursion::Continue`], normal execution
///   continues.
/// - If it returns [`TreeNodeRecursion::Stop`], recursion halts and propagates
///   [`TreeNodeRecursion::Stop`].
/// - If it returns [`TreeNodeRecursion::Jump`], the continuation behavior depends
///   on the traversal direction:
///   - For `UP` direction, the function returns with [`TreeNodeRecursion::Jump`],
///     bypassing further bottom-up closures until the next top-down closure.
///   - For `DOWN` direction, the function returns with [`TreeNodeRecursion::Continue`],
///     skipping further exploration.
